Superstreamer is a self hostable platform that aims to simplify the complexities of video delivery. Transcode and package your media for online streaming with simple API calls and sane defaults, or craft dynamic HLS playlists on the fly with bumpers, ads and filters.

- Transcode your video file into separate quality tracks (eg; 1080p, 720p, 480p).
- Write `HLS CMAF` playlists directly to S3, ready for playback!
- Want to insert a bumper like Netflix? Stitch it as an HLS interstitial on the fly.
- Insert linear ads as interstitials by providing a simple VMAP.
- Use our facade to interact with HLS.js, a heavily simplified wrapper that makes sense for player builders.
- Awesome React components to start building your own player.

Give us a ‚≠ê if you like our work. Much appreciated!
